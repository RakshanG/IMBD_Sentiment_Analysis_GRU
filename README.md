ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (GRU)

This project uses a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as **Positive ðŸ˜€** or **Negative ðŸ˜¡**.  
Itâ€™s built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed via **Streamlit** for interactive use.

ðŸš€ Features
- GRU-based neural network for text classification  
- Tokenizer & padding for handling variable-length reviews  
- Streamlit web app for real-time predictions  
- Confidence scores for each prediction
